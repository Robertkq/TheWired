This is a chat room I've made with my own library [kqnet](https://github.com/Robertkq/kqnet).

Hopefully this is a decent example for anyone trying to use the library.

Once properly connected into the Chat Room, by getting validated, you can press CTRL to write messages and press enter to send them
The chat room also supports 3 additional commands
```
/w <name> <message> - Whispers to the client who has that name
/r <message> - Replies to the last person who sent/received a message from the user with a whisper
/confetti - Surprise
